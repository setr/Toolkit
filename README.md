# Toolkit

Scripts that might be useful again later

TreeGenerator -- Parses an outline, pretty-prints in tree format.

p_euler -- Just going through the problem set from project euler in python, and playing with optimization. Stopped though, because it turns out project euler is more interested in mathematic solutions than programatic solutions.

conditional_parser -- An attempt to parse `if A and B or C and D` with python. Works, but doesn't handle precedence operators and simply reads left to right `(((A and B) or C) and D)`. A proper tokenizer probably would have made this a lot simpler, and more malleable.
