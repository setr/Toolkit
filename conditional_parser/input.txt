# If the first character is #, the line is ignored
# The node name currently needs to be single word.
# The description currently needs to be only on one line.
# there needs to be an empty last line 

# Node structure is as follows, line seperated. Empty line splits nodes.

# Node Name
# Description
# Series of conditions of the following form
    # if [condition] [value] go [node]
    # else [node]
# if statements can have an infinite number of conditions using 'and' and 'or'
    # if [condition] [and|or] [condition] go [node]
# conditions are read left to right. 
    # A and B or C and F 
    # becomes
    # ((((A and B) or C) and F)
# and first line that evaluates to true is executed.

# node with no conditionals are leaf nodes
# we must end with a leaf node for program to execute successfully.
